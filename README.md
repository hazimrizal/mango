# mango

A To-do list application called Mango

## Getting Started

This is a simple but educational project to learn the fundamentals of Flutter.
Its functionalities and syntax all began here in this application called Mango.

Mango would be one of the few applications I will develop whose names will be based on fruits.
Next one I'm going to name it Melon. But that's not important here.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
