# Mango

A To-do list application called Mango

## Getting Started

This is a simple but educational project to learn the fundamentals of Flutter.
Its functionalities and syntax all began here in this application called Mango.

Mango would be one of the few applications I will develop whose names will be based on fruits.
Next one I'm going to name it Melon. But that's not important here.
